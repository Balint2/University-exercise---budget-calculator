This is a small web application consisting of a backend and a frontend.  
It allows users to enter their incomes and expenses for different months and displays the results in a chart for better overview.

- **Backend:** ASP.NET, responsible for handling data input and serving it to the frontend.  
- **Frontend:** Vanilla JavaScript, used to interact with the user interface and render the chart.  

The main functionality:
1. Enter incomes and expenses for a chosen month.  
2. View the stored data.  
3. See a diagram that visualizes the financial balance across months.
